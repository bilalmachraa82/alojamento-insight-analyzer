**Containment Checklist:**
```bash
# Block malicious IP
curl -X POST /api/admin/security/block-ip \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"ip": "x.x.x.x", "reason": "Security incident"}'

# Revoke API keys
curl -X POST /api/admin/security/revoke-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"userId": "user-id"}'

# Invalidate all sessions for user
curl -X POST /api/admin/security/invalidate-sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"userId": "user-id"}'

# Enable security lockdown mode
curl -X POST /api/admin/security/lockdown \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'
```

### 3. Eradication (1-4 hours)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Identify root cause

### 4. Recovery (4-24 hours)

**Actions:**
- [ ] Restore systems from clean backups
- [ ] Verify system functionality
- [ ] Gradually restore services
- [ ] Monitor for recurring issues

**Recovery Phases:**
1. **Phase 1:** Restore critical systems (0-2 hours)
2. **Phase 2:** Restore supporting systems (2-8 hours)
3. **Phase 3:** Full service restoration (8-24 hours)

**Monitoring:**
- Enhanced monitoring for 7 days
- Daily security reviews
- User behavior analysis
- System performance checks

### 5. Post-Incident Activities (24-72 hours)

**Immediate (24 hours):**
- [ ] Complete incident report
